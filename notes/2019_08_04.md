## Overview

* Welcome to everyone and thanks!
* Today is pretty low-key, lots of talking
* Overview of what/why of the show, and the show structure
  * Two narrators and 3-4 salon/frame members pre-cast
  * Intro/suggestions
  * First frame/salon scene with conversation
  * First narrator steps forward with title
  * First story is told fore 20-25 minutes
  * Back to frame, more conversation
  * Second narrator steps forward with title and story for 20-ish minutes
  * Back to frame, continue conversation
  * One of the frame conversationalists steps forward with title, tells story for 20-25 minutes
  * That's it!
* Introductions - names, pronouns, background, why TBV?
* Horns of Silence 
  * if someone has the horns up, stop talking and look at Marc
* This is everyone's show - please let me know if there's anything I can do to make the experience work better for you
* Safety mechanisms
  * cut/brake/door is always open
  * Check in at the beginning of every rehearsal
  * Anonymous feedback form
  * We'll add and adjust as we proceed
* Intimacy/violence
  * Not much sex/romance in HPL stories
  * Because these stories are told through our lens, it's likely they will be included in our stories, and we want to make sure we can push boundaries without the actors feeling unsafe
  * Lots of horror is about the violation of boundaries - the *character's* boundaries, not the performer's
  * Three main modes: professional/casual, familiar/urgent, monster/cultist/full-contact
  * We'll work on these three in rehearsal, and add more as we enter into new territory
* Things we'll be covering in the rehearsal process
  * Lovecraftian tone and themes
  * Shape of story
  * Types of story
  * Narration/exposition
  * Playing with narrative distance
  * Personalizing the horror
  * Decolonizing Lovecraft
  * Show structure
  * Tech - lights, scoring, sounds, etc
  * Stagecraft - blocking, voice, projection, etc
