## Overview

### Warmups

* Walk around the space!

  * Pick one other person to follow, stay cool, normal
  * Add in starts/stops - when your person starts/stops, so do you
  * Add in jumps, change of speed, etc
  * Come to a stop, put your hand on your person's shoulder
* Stretches - Casey - and checkin (No grandmother stuff, give Samantha space, usual knees)
  * repeat limitations/off-topics, check in after stories
* Figure out a good in/out ritual - checkins after to ground out bleed

## Run Throughs

### Other notes
