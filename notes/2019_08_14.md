## Overview

### Warmups

  * Find someone interesting, casually follow them at normal speed
  * Alternate normal tempo with individual starts and stops 
  * Stretches - Brandon

### Salon Scenes

* 3-4 people in a "civilized" setting, talking
* Should be more "removed" than scenes with a narrator
  * Talking with each other, not to the audience
* Brainstorm types of people, locations
* Get 3-4 people up
  * Assign or choose characters with a strong POV
  * Start in the middle/in media res
  * Characters are engaged, but civil
    * Talk at "play" speed, leaving space, using full stops
  * Use philosophy, history, metaphor to cement viewpoints
  * Run for 2-3 minutes, grab a title from a spoken line
* Practice about four times
* Talk about how to integrate tech, have people raise hands or call out titles

### Opening Monologue Practice

* Shortcut ways to open a story:
  * Introduce yourself - name, occupation, location, family
  * Share a bit of philosophy regarding the matter at hand
  * Tell a bit of history about an important location, item, family, group, etc.
  * Start with the end of the story - murder/madness/suicide/etc
* Use all the lovely description/exposition techniques we've been practicing
  * Senses, emotions, memories, metaphors
  * Talk about things "outside" the moment/situation - "zoom out", discover things
* Move to Inciting Event - the "peeling wallpaper" or string to pull
  * Arrive somewhere new
  * Hear strange tales
  * Read news about strange events
  * Get a letter from a friend, faimily member, or colleague
  * Find or receive a strange artifact or item
