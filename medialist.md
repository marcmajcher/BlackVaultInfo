# The Black Vault Recommended Media

This is not *homework* per se, but immersing yourself in the source material will be very beneficial to gaining a deep understanding of the themes, tone, and structures we're going for.

If you *had* to do as little as possible, I'd say read the first three Lovecraft stories on the list (plus whatever shorter ones you like—some are, like, five-minute reads), The Black Stone, King in Yellow, Stealing Cthulhu (I can get you a pdf), and as much of the HP Lovecraft Literary Podcast as you can manage. 

## Lovecraft stories

These are my primary recommendations for Lovecraft reading, in rough order of preference. (My preference—you can find plenty of differing opinions and rankings out there.) All of his stories are public domain (more or less; it's complicated), and the full texts are available at http://hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/ 

* The Call of Cthulhu
* The Shadow Over Innsmouth
* The Whisperer in the Darkness
* The Colour Out of Space
* At the Mountains of Madness
* The Shadow Out of Time
* The Statement of Randolph Carter
* From Beyond
* The Temple
* Pickman's Model
* The Outsider
* The Music of Erich Zann
* The Haunter of the Dark
* The Thing on the Doorstep
* The Festival

* Facts Concerning the Late Arthur Jermyn and His Family
* In the Walls of Eryx
* Nyarlathotep

## Podcasts

https://hppodcraft.com/

The main podcast I'm always going to recommend is the H.P. Lovecraft Literary Podcast (at hppodcraft.com *scream*). They go through all of his stories in chronological order, summarizing them and talking about all the stuff about them. Then they go into all of the authors around him, and all of the inspirations and notable fiction he talks about in his writings. It's incredibly informative and entertaining, and I can't recommend their readings of his stories enough to get a great feel for the tone and flavor of his writing when spoken aloud. (Andrew Lehman and Rachel Ford Lackey are treasures.)

## Movies / TV

* The HP Lovecraft Historical Society's movies: Call of Cthulhu, Whisperer in Darkness, etc.
* Dagon
* The Mist
* John Carpenter's The Thing
